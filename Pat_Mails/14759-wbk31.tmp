I have loaded all of the computers with the background that you wanted. <BR>
I'll stop by later this afternoon to give back your thumbdrive.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this morning stop by my office - I have a company logo I created on my<BR>
&gt; thumb drive.&nbsp; I'd like it installed as a background on all of the<BR>
&gt; computers.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Thanks,<BR>
