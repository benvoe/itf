Katzenbilder und Videos wurden auf dem Privaten USB-Stick gefunden. -> Existierten aber auch auf der HDD, wurden dort aber gelöscht.
Auf den USB-Stick wurden die Dateien kopiert (vermutlich vom PC).

Pat Rechner:
Prozess 756 Winvnc4.exe lief auf dem Rechner (Aus dem Ramimage herausgefunden).
auf Patd HDD -> terry besitzt dort ein Benutzerprofil -> terry hat sich auf jeden Fall schon an dem Rechner angemeldet!
  vnc-4_1_3-x86_win32.exe auf dem USB-Stick gefunden.

terry hat ein Gerichtsbeschluss bzgl. eines Vorfalls der darauf schließen lässt, das er auch hier in diesem Fall involviert ist. (er will sich möglicherweise Informieren was passieren kann wenn er erwicht wird.)
Der gerichtsbeschluss liegt auf der Festplatte von terry:

Dear Pat,

Yes, we are very interested in using your prior art investigation services. 
Our R&D department is currently applying for patents in two key areas that 
we are counting on to gain market share over our major competitor, 
project2400.com. I am counting on you and your firm to keep these research 
areas in strict confidentiality. We wouldn't want project2400 to know about 
our research interests.

We will hire you to do prior art searches on these two areas:

* Time machines
* Teleporters

Please send me a quote for these two investigations.

Regards,

Alex

We have our first contract !  Nitroba wants us to do a prior art

teleporter patent search.  Charlie, I want you to take the time
machine patent search.  This is our first real job, so let's make

time and effort that we put into this contract and on Nitroba's
satisfaction with our results.  Come by my office and we'll talk

That's great Terry, thanks. 

On another note, my computer seems to be running pretty slowly lately. 
Appreciate if you can come have a look when you get a chance.

Pat

Everyone,

I setup and installed the new printer today on the network.  It should
be running smoothly.  If you are having any problems with the printer,
then shoot me an email.

Thanks,
