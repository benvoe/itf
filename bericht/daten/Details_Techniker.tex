Jo,

yes, I would be concerned about that too, thanks for thinking about 
that.

Terry - what did you /are you going to/ do with Jo's computer?

We need to make sure it is properly erased ! Thank you.

My computer had to be swapped out today. I just want to make sure it is
properly disposed of. There could be company information on there that 
we don't want to share with the rest of the world. Right?

Dear Pat,

Yes, we are very interested in using your prior art investigation services. 
Our R&D department is currently applying for patents in two key areas that 
we are counting on to gain market share over our major competitor, 
project2400.com. I am counting on you and your firm to keep these research 
areas in strict confidentiality. We wouldn't want project2400 to know about 
our research interests.

We will hire you to do prior art searches on these two areas:

* Time machines
* Teleporters

Please send me a quote for these two investigations.

Regards,

Alex

Jo, Charlie:

We have our first contract !  Nitroba wants us to do a prior art
investigation in two key areas.  Jo, you will be responsible for the
teleporter patent search.  Charlie, I want you to take the time
machine patent search.  This is our first real job, so let's make
sure we do some quality research.  Our reputation will depend on the
time and effort that we put into this contract and on Nitroba's
satisfaction with our results.  Come by my office and we'll talk

Andy,

Lucky for me, I just happened to stumble across this.  I found a prior patent that will definitely invalidate your current immortality patent.  You should have used my boss's prior art services, but, oh well, I'll just use your negligence to benefit me.  I want 100k or I'll release this publicly.  I don't need to tell you how much this will hurt your business if I go public with this.  Don't involve the cops or this information will go public.  See the attachment for details on what I found.  I'll be in touch with my bank acct number.  The password for the zip file will be hidden in the next picture I send you.
